# SF Neighborhood Quiz

A fun interactive map of san francisco where your knowledge of SF is challendged. Try to guess all 117 neighborhoods in time get on the leaderboard!

## Description

this app is for people who enjoy testing their knowledge of geography and San Francisco.

### Why

I became addicted to geography quizes in my free time, and after learning about every country's location, I wanted to do the same for SF. I realized there weren't any quizes to my liking so I decided to make my own.

along with an interest in the subject, my projects also involve learning a new technology or reinforcing fundamentals. this project helped me learn more about D3.js libary and GeoJSON data.

FUN FACT

depending on who you ask, you might get conflicting answers about how many nehgborhoods are in SF. Even SF's own city departments can't agree on Neighborhood Boundaries!

## How to install

No installation needed. just follow the link and start playing.

## How to use

The quiz starts once you visit the site. The name of the current neighbood will be displayed, and your task is to click on the corresponding location.

you get three guesses. Once you've depleted all your guesses, the correct location will glow red and white. click on it to continue to the next location.

Once you complete the quiz, you will be prompted for a username to submit your scores. the percentage of correct answers plus the time it took to finish the game will be used to calculate your position on the leaderboard.
